##The project
A redesign of [benjaminkinzer.com] from the beginning to completion. An opportunity to document, understand how I approach projects and find ways to refine my methods of design. I will also be using this opportunity to design within the web browser and prototype features. This is also my opportunity to challenge my skillset in the areas of Javascript, Ruby and Node. 

What's design in the browser? We skip over the wireframing and Photoshop files. Eliminating the need to maintain dozens of Photoshop files for various screen sizes. We have a design that is interactive and we can test screen sizes early on to make sure the design works for all our viewers. 

You can follow the project on [Github](https://github.com/kungfukoala/kungfukoala.github.io)

###Draft 0.1 - My assumed Methods

1. Research (Remember Dyson Vacuum) or what my partner [Chlo√© Frommer] does so well.
2. Concepts & Content
3. Content Prioritization
4. Style Board [Style Tiles](http://styletil.es/)
5. Layout
6. Design
7. Interaction (I'm on the fence whether this should become before design or after. Let's find out.)

###Draft 0.2 - Revised Methods

1. Research
2. <s>Concepts & Content</s> 
2. Content (May replace with Vision, see below)
3. <s>Content Prioritization</s> 
3. Concept
4. <s>Style Board [Style Tiles](http://styletil.es/)</s>
5. <s>Layout</s>
6. Design
6. Interaction (I'm on the fence whether this should become before design or after. Let's find out.)

####Why the change?

#####Content
Content is something to be expressed according to the [Dictionary](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/content?s=t). This is the foundation of our project. Hopefully through a Research and Questions we have curated enough content to proceed with the project. Or we can create an outline that can later be edited during Visioning.

#####Concept
I'm currently debating whether or not I should replace Concept for Vision. To me Vision better captures the phase of anticipating and dreaming of ideas that will express the content. I've also moved **Style Board** into Vision.

#####Design
We've removed **Content Prioritization**, **Layout**. Both of these categories can easily be combined into the **Design** phase.






 

##Notes
This is part of a series "[Method of Design]" redesign of [benjaminkinzer.com], were we are unpacking a design methods.
