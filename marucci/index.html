I view my trade as a way of crafting experiences through constant refinement and persistance to produce great work.
</div>

<p>I would be honored to work for a company that has built it’s reputation on craftsmenship and quality. My role as a designer is to design for the audience/users, understand their needs and deliver an experience they will remember and talk about. In my work I try to find a balance between heritage which tells a story and trends that keep the brand relevant in the marketplace.</p>

<p>My background is in Advertising, Packaging and Branding where I have 12 years experience. In the last 4 years I’ve been growing my skillset by working with responsive websites and mobile apps. I consider myself an intermediate developer who focuses primarily on the user experience and interface design. I write all my own code by hand with HTML5 and SASS; and have enough knowledge to work with JQuery, Javascript, Node, PHP and Ruby. I’m currently taking online classes for Javascript and Node. </p>

<p>In the last few months I’ve been experimenting with a new method to designing websites within the browser. It’s allowed me to avoid difficult translations from Mockup’s to Prototype. This process has also reduced the amount of Photoshop files and provides an opportunity for key stakeholders to participate in the design process in the earlier stages of design and development.</p>

<p>I hope you will consider me for the position as Web Designer for Marucci. If given the opportunity I will ensure to build and design an experience that matches the reputation of Marucci craftsmenship. I currently live in Santa Barbar, California and looking to work remotely as my family resides here. I’ve worked the past 6 years remotely for an TBD and JUJU. I would be willing to travel when necessary. I’m familiar with Git, Trello, Basecamp and Slack; but always open and willing to learn new ways of collaborating remotely.</p>

<h3 id="jacksons-corner">Jacksons Corner</h3>
<p>Jackson’s Corner is a restaurant in Bend, Oregon that provides the experience of being local. The restaurant is decorated in a way to make people feel at home, with beautiful eclectic mix of kitchen tables. They’ve worked hard to keep prices reasonable while maintaining a high standard of organic produce and meats from local farms. I really wanted to capture the interior of the restaurant and focusing on the ingredients of Jackson’s Corner. We are currently working on a few small updates that will include a gallery of photos and an updated map for their second location. </p>

<h3 id="extending-sweetness">Extending Sweetness</h3>
<p>Extending Sweetness is for a short docu-drama film about a young woman named Chipo who is balancing a life of a post-modern world of attending school and learning traditional rainmaking knowledge. Unfortunately in a post modern world, traditional rainmaking is no longer viewed as necessary. The film explores the possibility of creating balance with tradition and a new post-modern society in Zimbabwe, Africa. </p>

<h3 id="juju">JUJU</h3>
<p>JUJU is an iPhone app that allows anyone to create collages with artists illustrations, photographs, and typography. We wanted a brand that was approachable and creative. Something that would inspire the artist inside everyone and see the potential they could unlock creatively. I was responsible for the design and experience of both the App and Website. </p>

<h3 id="chloe-frommer">Chloe Frommer</h3>
<p>Chloé Frommer is a Filmmaker and Ethnographer. She had a specific idea of breaking the site into two distinct sections. One to focus on her filmography and the second on her ethnographic research. This is a site where all the design has happened within the browser. There are new features coming soon and are available publicly on GITHUB here: <a href="https://github.com/chloefrommer/chloefrommer.github.io/issues">GITHUB Issues</a> </p>

<h3 id="baldhead-cabinets">Baldhead Cabinets</h3>
<p>Baldhead Cabinets is based in Bend, Oregon and designs and builds high-end custom cabinets for Residential and Commercial spaces. We wanted to convey the craftsmanship of a custom Baldhead Cabinet by use of a hero shot of a custom built cabinet that would showcase some of the features available. I was also responsible for the art direction for all the photography on the site. Photography by Steve Tague.</p>

<h3 id="tedxbend">TEDxBend</h3>
<p>TEDxBend is an annual event where Speakers are asked to visit Bend and share their ideas. I remember having the kick-off meeting and given the headline Bending Rules. Our campaign for the event would be circulating before we would have confirmed speakers. I wanted to stay within the color scheme and guidelines of TEDx, but also wanted a play on Bending Rules. I found several visual illusions the bend the rules and play tricks on our eyes. We had developed a website, posters, email newsletter and print advertising campaign to promote the event. </p>

<h3 id="julia-junkin">Julia Junkin</h3>
<p>Julia Junkin is a licensed artist who wanted to literally create a Wonderland for her site. We dreamed up this home page that people could scroll and if explored closely could find hidden gems. This site was created before the days of responsive design. Although there has been discussion about preparing the site for smaller screens. To keep load times down I created a series of Sprites to reduce the amount of HTTP requests. </p>

<h1 id="profile">Profile</h1>
<p>My name is Benjamin Kinzer and I have 12 years of branding, art direction and design experience. My main focus over the last few years has been Advertising and Packaging for the beer industry. I worked 6 years as the Lead Art Director for 21st Amendment Brewery in San Francisco, turning a small craft brewery into one of the fastest growing breweries in North America, through unique story-telling experience. I’ve also been working as the Lead Designer for a startup who developed a creative iPhone app for JUJU which successfully launched an MVP into the iTunes store.</p>

<p>When I’m not working, I spend my time with my family cross-country skiing, playing catch, swimming in rivers and tent camping in the mountains. Another part of my excitement for this job is my son’s 7th birthday is coming soon and he will be getting his first new baseball mitt. I’m looking forward to when he gets to sleep with his mitt wrapped around a baseball all night! One of my fondest moments of being a child.</p>
