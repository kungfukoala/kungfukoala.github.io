TEDxBend is an annual event where Speakers are asked to visit Bend and share their ideas. I remember having the kick-off meeting and given the headline Bending Rules. Our campaign for the event would be cirulating before we would have confirmed speakers. I wanted to stay within the color scheme and guidelines of TEDx, but also wanted a play on Bending Rules. I found several visual illusions the bend the rules and play tricks on our eyes. We had developed a website, posters, email newsletter and print advertising campaign to promote the event.
