##Inspiration
What is inspiring this new direction with [benjaminkinzer.com].



I love print and I'm excited where websites are headed with the ability to produce beautiful sites that feel like a beautiful magazine and your also able to add motion.

My first inspiration for this new site is the mysterious [KELLERHOUSE](http://www.kellerhouse.com/). Okay, yes the work is breath taking and one cannot complain about the work. But I also appreciate the site because it's simple and immersive. Pulls you in. Just how a well design print piece can pull you in, and hopefully you have the content to back up the reason why you pulled someone in.

The border between print and online has been desolved.

Don't get me wrong I still love picking up a magazine or a good book. [Good Reads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6202773-benjamin-kinzer). And my other inspiration is actually the book [Made You Look]() by Stefen Sagmeister. I originally purchased the book to obviously drool over Stefan's work, but what I didn't know is that I would also be brought into his office life and insecurities. It was helpful to read such personal notes, helps us feel we are not alone int he world when we share stories.




Example:
B is for Bunny - M first pet was a bunny named Thumper. Actually, I had a few fish before Thumper, but I couldn't keep them alive long enough to really remember their names. Still unsure why my parents thought I was fit to raise a bunny after so many toilet flushing sessions. Plus Thumper Kendall makes a great striper name alias. :)




I'm also working on sharing my methods, I would love to share my unused work, articles on what inspires me, I would also love to begin developing content to help other designers, and maybe a little play. With that let's see if we can create the beginnings of a content outline.


My current thinking is you click on a post and it goes to a category page that displays all the backstories for the project. Here's the hierarchy I see currently:
1.

The current usability problem I have is sorting these categories? If I have multiple posts that are added at a later date the final work could be pushed to the bottom. One thought is to create a category called "final" which would always site at the top of the list.**Home**
Our home will be a typical collection of posts, but using more imagery and less text.

**Articles**
By selection a post you will be presented with that post and related posts such as quotes, backstories, concept sketches, and the final work.

**Work**

**Profile**
The majority of the content on this page will be static. However, I typically have a hard time meeting new people due to some fear of rejection or awkward silence. I've come up with a new tool hopefully to break the ice and I wanted to include it on my website. It's based of children's alphabet books (Could be happening as I have read many of these to my son).
