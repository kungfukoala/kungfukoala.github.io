##Future
This is a side note to a framework I'm working on for my future projects. It's called underscore and I would love to in the future have clients interacting with the design early on and gather data through analytics to improve the user experience and the help of ethnographer who would help us uncover the hidden gems that are missing on the site. 

I've seen through advertising that presenting sketches and involving the client early on in the process can be rewarding. It often requires a little education, but in the end great ideas are born and everyone feels a sense of accomplishment by the end of the project. It's worked well throughout the years on 21st Amendment Brewing work.

Check this out we already have a content outline, wireframes and a responsive website.
