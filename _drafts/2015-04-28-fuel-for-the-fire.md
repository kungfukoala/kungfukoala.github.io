<div class="introduction">
  You may have matches or maybe some flint, most likely a lighter. These are great tools, but without the wood/fuel we are not going to be successful at making a fire.

But, before we dive into this post, I've been struggling on combining Content with Concepts. In my previous post [Unknown Truths] I created a draft outline for the "Methods of Design". But I'm already finding a flaw in my draft outline, so let's revise my assumed methods of design from post [Unknown Truths]:

###Revised Method

1. Research
2. <s>Concepts & Content</s> 
2. Content
3. <s>Content Prioritization</s> 
3. Concept
4. <s>Style Board [Style Tiles](http://styletil.es/)</s>
5. <s>Layout</s>
6. Design
6. Interaction (I'm on the fence whether this should become before design or after. Let's find out.)

####Why the change?

#####Content
Content is something to be expressed according to the [Dictionary](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/content?s=t). This is the foundation of our project. Hopefully through a Research and Questions we have curated enough content to proceed with the project. Or we can create an outline that can later be edited during Visioning.

#####Concept
I'm currently debating whether or not I should replace Concept for Vision. To me Vision better captures the phase of anticipating and dreaming of ideas that will express the content. I've also moved **Style Board** into Vision.


> "Most of my work happens when I'm day dreaming"


#####Design
We've removed **Content Prioritization**, **Layout**. Both of these categories can easily be combined into the **Design** phase.

##Content for Vision

With those adjustments in place we can focus on what our content will be!

For me content is critical when working on a project. Without content it's difficult to generate concepts. Of course there is always the problem with horrible content, but if you did your research you shouldn't have horrible content. If you still have horrible content you might want to reconsider why you are working on the project in the first place or you need to dig deeper. Unfortunately, I believe we are doing a lot of the research along the way with the redesign of [benjaminkinzer.com], but that is okay. Rules don't apply to all scenarios and should always remain soft like water.

> “Water is fluid, soft, and yielding. But water will wear away rock, which is rigid and cannot yield. As a rule, whatever is fluid, soft, and yielding will overcome whatever is rigid and hard. This is another paradox: what is soft is strong.” 
― Lao Tzu

Let's begin with a few assumptions. I'm an Art Directior and Designer so it's key that I show my **work**. I'm also going to be writing articles and sharing other articles, video and images that inspire me. So let's attempt our basic content outline. 

###Content outline

1. Logo
2. Navigation
  - Filters
    - Clients
    - Development
    - Design
    - Personal
3. Home
  - Query
    - Articles
    - Work
4. Articles
  - Post Title
  - Featured Image
  - Meta
  - Read Time
  - Categories
  - Tags
5. Work
  - Title
  - Featured Image
  - Meta
  - Images
  - Categories
  - Tags
6. Profile
  - Short Biography
  - Contact Information
  - Short Stories
  - Follow Me

Now that we have our content outline finished we can begin gathering our content for the project. Ex. Images of work, photographs,  articles, quotes, awards, biography... the list could go on. We already have two articles and I'm love multiples of three; so we should gather three pieces of work, three quotes and one more article if possible. Then we will also find our biography, which I'm sure needs editing. 

Once we have gathered and published our content we can move onto the next post **Concept**. 

##Notes
This is part of a series "[Method of Design]" redesign of [benjaminkinzer.com], were we are unpacking a design methods.
