I'm laying on the floor of our little one bedroom house preparing for the interview I never imagined I would be having. I was about to be on the phone with Bill Cahan of [Cahan & Associates](http://designarchives.aiga.org/#/entries/%2Bcredits%3A%22Cahan%20%26%20Associates%22/_/grid/relevance/desc/0/27/120). I remember receiving my first Typography Annual 



I knew everyone who worked for Bill and had their book I'm almost Always Hungry. I only dreamed of working for Cahan & Associates; I had an interview with Bill Cahan. I F*%KING FAILED! I'm not kidding. The interview I did well at, but he was afraid I could not come up with an intelligent concept; granted at the time I had no work to really show my love for ideas. Plus I couldn't write, which is what he expected from all of his employees. Hence why the redsign of my site is all about **writing**. At least I'm kind of learning from Bill from a distance. I hope one day I can meet him in person over a drink or coffee. Of course in my head it would play out all so well "I would be like hey Bill I doubt you remember me..." and of course we would laugh.

Anyways...
