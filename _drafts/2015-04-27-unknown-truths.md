<div class="introduction">
  "In my music, I’m trying to play the truth of what I am. The reason it’s difficult is because I’m changing all the time." - Charles Mingus
</div>

Charles Mingus quote is exactly how I feel about the redesign of [benjaminkinzer.com]. Working on personal projects is a challenge, but they're not for off from client projects. They all feel like a Dyson vacuum cleaner in the beginning. You have one job; to vacuum up thousands of dust particles. You're a vacuum cleaner this should be fairly simple, right? 

Now replace dust particles with **truths**. Your job is to decipher a few truths out of a thousand. The truths you find will be the framework for building concepts. So, yeah you begin to feel like our friend the Skeleton who is wandering with a dust cloud of particles around his head.

##The Truth
Right now, I'm currently at eight re-writes and four introductions. I'm struggling with the fear of exposing myself to the world in what may appear to be very unpolished presentation of my capabilities. I'm also having to reflect upon my own **truths**, instead of discovering a clients.

###My assumed Method

1. Research (Remember Dyson Vacuum) or what my partner [Chloé Frommer] does so well.
2. Concepts & Content
3. Content Prioritization
4. Style Board [Style Tiles](http://styletil.es/)
5. Layout
6. Design
7. Interaction (I'm on the fence whether this should become before design or after. Let's find out.)
