<div class="introduction">
  "Working on my own projects is F*&King hard."
</div>

I'm not a confident person, at least I'm not confident when I'm unsure the reason I'm talking to someone. I enjoy the small group where the energy is exchanged and people are free to share ideas. Deciding to write a blog is now beginning to feel like a huge mistake. I have to admit I'm coming up with a lot of great excuses to why I should stop now before it get's too late.

However, my ultimate goal for the redesign of [benjaminkinzer.com] is to have some fun. This self-doubt is not helping.
