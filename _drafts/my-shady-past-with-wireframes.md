When I first started design as an Intern at The Office of Bill Chiaravalle, I would hear about the different projects Bill had to complete while he was at design school. However, I missed out on some of these basic design principle classes. However, I learned a lot of those principles through actually working on tedious projects for Bill. For todays post on Wireframes, I felt the three objects and how you can view them is a great introduction to my issue with wireframes. Everyone has their own methods to reach a conclusion and for me I've never really taken the time to explain my approach to projects. 

So how does a circle, square and triangle relate to wireframes? Well wireframes are a grouping of blocks that have descriptive labels. 



Black and white Helvetica contained in a perfect hierarchy of information. I had just started an internship at The Office of Bill Chiaravalle and my job was to design the Nutritional Facts for Krusteaz Pancakes and Brownies. I had no idea what white space, kerning, leading, or tracking was and all kerning was a mystery and I would get frustrated when Bill would claim you could drive a truck through my kerning work on Nutrition Labels. I love and loathed it. In fact I was bored.  However, Bill was teaching me the foundation of communication in design. I learned all my foundations from Bill and also the history of design. Bill also introduced me to the wide range of designers such as Jennifer Sterling, David Carson, Chip Kidd, Carol Divine Carson and Erik Speikerman... and how they used design to communicate.

I've been working on websites for awhile now and one part of the process I've always loathed was Wireframes. I love the idea conceptually, but from a designers perspective they assume too much. I've tried to develop a more positive relationship with Wireframes, but Wireframes an myself are more on the terms of awkward glances. 

However, in Advertising we approach all projects with paper and pencil to explore concepts, ideas and content. This becomes our foundation for refinement and presentation of the possibilities. I find Wireframes assume too much and force us to contain imagination. I do understand that wireframes are here to focus on content. I get why developers head that direction. But I also come from a background of print and the technology is here now to allow us to create experiencess that are unique to what device we are on. Nutrition Facts worked for one application and that was to provide information. But life is not all about information, it's also about love, movement, dancing, touch, haptics, dreaming, challenging us and also easy at times. 

There is a UX Meetup on your favorite wireframing tools and I was excited to share the concept of design in the browser. But I realized I'm still skipping over wireframing. I focus on the content and concepts; your certainly able to click on links. But it is not a wireframe. But from this basic content structure I want to begin thinking about layout. Everyone has their own process and this is my thoughts from what I've learned over the last two years.

I've decided to redesign [benjaminkinzer.com](http://benjaminkinzer.com) as an experiment of designing in the browser along with [Chlo√© Frommer](http://www.chloefrommer.com). Hoping this will inspire or help other designers and developers. If not, well at least I will have a process I enjoy and believe works.

##The Proposed Process
Responsive design is here and even though it presents a lot of challenges, responsive design also offers an opportunity to create unqiue experiences across multiple platforms. The huge challenge for designers is having multiple Photoshop files that can be tedious to update or showing a design that will not translate so easily and exceed the budget parameters. 

What we will be working on over the next couple of days is an illustration of moving from Content, Wireframes, Structure and Design. We will be discussing iterative design, art direction and the difficulties with responsivness.

1. Content & Concepts
2. Content Prioritization
3. Design and Tonal Board
4. Layout Design
5. Design
6. Interaction (I'm on the fence whether this should become before design or after. Let's find out.)

##Content & Concept
Here is a content outline of where I'm headed with the website. Best place to start any projects is by asking a few questions of what we are hoping this website will do or solve. 

One of my favorite sites to visit is [KELLERHOUSE](http://www.kellerhouse.com/); it feels like a print brochure. It has both work and what appears to be conceptual work that was never selected. I love this approach as I feel the that web technologies have progressed enough that we can now have a little more visual fun. I also love that you can tell stories visually with ease. The border between print and online has been desolved and we can now blend the two worlds. Don't get me wrong I still love picking up a magazine or a good book. [Good Reads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6202773-benjamin-kinzer). Another inpsiration was [Made You Look]() by Stefen Sagmiester and how he revealed personal journal entries along with showcasing his work. I'm kind of hoping I can merge these two worlds and create something fun for people to view and read. 

Let's start with our content outline.

As you can see it's a pretty simple website.

**Home**
Our home will be a typical collection of posts, but using more imagery and less text. 

**Posts**
By selection a post you will be presented with that post and related posts such as quotes, backstories, concept sketches, and the final work.

**Profile**
The majority of the content on this page will be static. However, I typically have a hard time meeting new people due to some fear of rejection or awkward silence. I've come up with a new tool hopefully to break the ice and I wanted to include it on my website. It's based of children's alphabet books (Could be happening as I have read many of these to my son). 

Example:
B is for Bunny - M first pet was a bunny named Thumper. Actually, I had a few fish before Thumper, but I couldn't keep them alive long enough to really remember their names. Still unsure why my parents thought I was fit to raise a bunny after so many toilet flushing sessions. Plus Thumper Kendall makes a great striper name alias. :)

##Future
This is a side note to a framework I'm working on for my future projects. It's called underscore and I would love to in the future have clients interacting with the design early on and gather data through analytics to improve the user experience and the help of ethnographer who would help us uncover the hidden gems that are missing on the site. 

I've seen through advertising that presenting sketches and involving the client early on in the process can be rewarding. It often requires a little education, but in the end great ideas are born and everyone feels a sense of accomplishment by the end of the project. It's worked well throughout the years on 21st Amendment Brewing work.

Check this out we already have a content outline, wireframes and a responsive website.


##Notes and Credits
You could possibly be stumbling upon my site at the moment and wondering "Is this person really a designer?". Actually, yes I am. If you would like to see my work you can visit my archived site here [2015.benjaminkinzer.com](http://2015.benjaminkinzer.com)


My current thinking is you click on a post and it goes to a category page that displays all the backstories for the project. Here's the hierarchy I see currently:
1. 

The current usability problem I have is sorting these categories? If I have multiple posts that are added at a later date the final work could be pushed to the bottom. One thought is to create a category called "final" which would always site at the top of the list.
